# Motorcycle parts sales analysis

## Description
This project analyzes sales data from a company operating three warehouses that sell motorcycle parts through both retail and wholesale channels. The focus is on understanding **wholesale revenue** by product line, broken down by month and warehouse.

Net revenue calculations take into account the different fees associated with each payment method (credit card, cash, bank transfer).

The goal is to provide the board of directors with clear insights into how wholesale revenue varies across warehouses and over time.

## Objectives
- Calculate net revenue for each product line
- Group results by month and warehouse
- Filter data to include only wholesale orders
- Account for payment method fees in revenue calculations

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL

## Project Structure
- `queries/` – SQL queries for net revenue calculations and grouping
- `results/` – Summaries and visualizations (optional)
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation
